## üöÄ What I Do
   Frontend Development: I create engaging and responsive UIs using React and Next.js, providing optimal user experiences across all devices.
   Backend Development: I design and implement efficient APIs with Express.js, NestJS, and Next.js, connecting them to PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data storage.
   Database Management: I design schemas and manage databases using PostgreSQL and MongoDB, ensuring data integrity and efficient queries.
   Cloud Deployment: I deploy full-stack applications to cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, Firebase, and Vercel, ensuring smooth performance and scalability.
   Testing: I ensure that my applications are bug-free and reliable by writing unit and integration tests using tools like Jest and Cypress.

## üå± Learning & Growth

I'm constantly learning and improving my skills. Currently, I'm focused on:
    Serverless Architectures: Leveraging serverless computing with AWS Lambda and Firebase Functions.
    TypeScript: Further integrating TypeScript for better type safety and scalability in my JavaScript projects.
